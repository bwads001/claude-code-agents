# Specialized Agents

This directory contains **specialized agent definitions** that extend Claude Code with domain-specific expertise. Agents are sub-assistants that handle specific tasks while the main Claude instance orchestrates the overall workflow through direct delegation.

## What Are Agents?

Agents are specialized versions of Claude designed for focused domains. They have their own system prompts, tool access, and behavioral patterns, enabling expert-level assistance without the complexity of multi-tier orchestration.

**Core Architecture:**
- **Main thread orchestration**: YOU coordinate all agent work directly
- **Hook-based automation**: Quality gates and context injection handled automatically
- **Output style integration**: Agents adapt behavior based on research/planning/execution modes
- **Domain specialization**: Each agent focuses on specific expertise areas

**Key Principles:**
- Agents are invoked by the main Claude instance using the `Task` tool
- Each agent has specialized knowledge for specific domains
- Agents cannot call other agents - all coordination happens at the main level
- Hooks automatically provide context and handle quality validation
- Agents report back with comprehensive context for main thread integration

## How to Use Agents

### Main Thread Orchestration Pattern

**Your Role:** Coordinate agents directly based on task requirements
**Agent Role:** Execute specialized work and report back with context
**Hook Role:** Automatically inject context and validate quality

```bash
# Main thread decides and coordinates:
"I need user authentication implemented"
‚Üì
1. Use project-manager to move plan from backlog ‚Üí active
2. Use feature-architect-planner if detailed planning needed
3. Use backend-database-engineer for database/API work
4. Use frontend-ui-specialist for UI components
5. Use code-quality-reviewer for integration testing
6. Use git-workflow-specialist for commits and PR
7. Use project-manager to move plan to completed
```

### Agent Selection Decision Tree

1. **Git operations needed?** ‚Üí `git-workflow-specialist`
2. **Files >300 lines?** ‚Üí `file-refactor-organizer`
3. **Database/API work?** ‚Üí `backend-database-engineer` 
4. **UI/component work?** ‚Üí `frontend-ui-specialist`
5. **Quality validation needed?** ‚Üí `code-quality-reviewer`
6. **Library research needed?** ‚Üí `documentation-specialist`
7. **Complex feature planning?** ‚Üí `feature-architect-planner`
8. **Planning docs management?** ‚Üí `project-manager`

### Mandatory Delegation Rules

**CRITICAL: DO NOT perform actions directly when an agent specialist exists.**

**‚ùå Instead of:**
- "Let me create this component..."
- "I'll run the tests..."  
- "Let me commit these changes..."

**‚úÖ Always say:**
- "I'll use frontend-ui-specialist to create this component..."
- "I'll use code-quality-reviewer for testing and quality validation..."
- "I'll use git-workflow-specialist to commit these changes..."

## Integration with Hook System

### Automatic Quality Pipeline

Your system eliminates manual quality management through hooks:

```
Agent Invocation ‚Üí Context Injection Hook ‚Üí Agent Work ‚Üí Validation Hook
      ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                    ‚Üì              ‚Üì
  Task Decision      Auto-inject context    Expert work    Auto-validate
```

### Hook-Handled Automation

- **Context Injection:** Agents automatically receive project structure, ai-docs/, git context
- **Quality Validation:** Lint, typecheck, and code standards handled automatically
- **Performance Monitoring:** Agent usage patterns tracked and optimized
- **Result Validation:** Agent outputs checked against quality standards

### What Agents Focus On

Since hooks handle automation, agents focus purely on:
- **Domain expertise:** Deep knowledge in their specialization
- **Complex reasoning:** Decisions that require domain understanding
- **Integration guidance:** How their work connects to the broader system
- **Context-aware implementation:** Using injected context effectively

## Output Style Integration

Agents adapt their behavior based on your current workflow mode:

### Research Mode (`/output-style research`)
- **documentation-specialist:** Primary agent for exploration and learning
- **All agents:** Focus on discovery and understanding over implementation
- **Integration:** Emphasis on documenting findings in ai-docs/

### Planning Mode (`/output-style planning`)
- **feature-architect-planner:** Primary agent for design and specifications
- **project-manager:** Coordinates planning document lifecycle
- **Integration:** Creates implementation-ready plans for execution mode

### Execution Mode (`/output-style execution`)
- **Backend/Frontend specialists:** Primary agents for implementation
- **git-workflow-specialist:** Essential for parallel development coordination
- **Integration:** Follows established plans, focuses on delivery and quality

## Parallel Orchestration Workflow

Perfect for your tmux + git worktrees setup:

### Multi-Pane Development
```bash
# Pane 1: Shared dev branch
project-manager: Coordinates overall development state

# Pane 2: Feature A (auth worktree)
backend-database-engineer + frontend-ui-specialist: Auth implementation

# Pane 3: Feature B (inventory worktree)  
backend-database-engineer + frontend-ui-specialist: Inventory system

# Pane 4: Feature C (reporting worktree)
documentation-specialist + backend-database-engineer: Report system
```

### Git Worktree Coordination
- **git-workflow-specialist:** Handles all worktree operations, branch management
- **Enhanced statusline:** Shows worktree context, change counts, total worktrees
- **Context hooks:** Automatically inject worktree-specific context to agents

## Agent Configuration Structure

Each agent is defined by a Markdown file in this directory:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Clear description with usage guidance and examples
model: sonnet
color: color-name
tools: comma,separated,tool,list
---

# Agent System Prompt
Detailed instructions for specialized behavior and domain expertise.

## Integration Requirements  
How the agent works with hooks, other agents, and the main orchestration thread.

## Reporting Standards
Expected output format and context information for main thread integration.
```

## Best Practices

### Agent Coordination
- **Trust the specialization:** Agents are experts in their domains with automatic context
- **Provide clear task context:** Specific requirements and integration points
- **Review agent reports:** Integration guidance and next steps for main thread
- **Update ai-docs:** When agents discover new patterns or solutions

### Quality Assurance
- **Let hooks handle automation:** No manual lint/typecheck in conversations  
- **Use code-quality-reviewer:** For complex testing and manual validation
- **Coordinate through main thread:** All agent-to-agent work flows through you
- **Maintain documentation:** Agents contribute to ai-docs/ for future context injection

### Workflow Optimization
- **Match agents to output styles:** Research agents for discovery, implementation agents for execution
- **Batch related work:** Coordinate frontend + backend + quality for complete features
- **Use git-workflow-specialist:** For all git operations in parallel development
- **Monitor through hooks:** Performance and usage patterns automatically tracked

This agent system transforms Claude Code into a **specialized development team** with automatic quality gates, seamless context management, and expert coordination - all orchestrated through your direct main-thread control.
