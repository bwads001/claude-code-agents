# Troubleshooting Knowledge Base

This directory contains solutions to common issues encountered in multi-agent development workflows.

## Purpose

Maintain a searchable knowledge base of problems and solutions that agents and developers can reference to resolve issues quickly.

## Content Guidelines

### Issue Categories
- Agent selection and invocation problems
- Hook execution and configuration issues  
- MCP integration and tool access failures
- Project setup and onboarding difficulties
- Performance and coordination challenges

### Solution Format
Each troubleshooting document should include:
- **Problem Description**: Clear symptoms and error messages
- **Root Cause**: Technical explanation of why issue occurs
- **Solution Steps**: Step-by-step resolution process
- **Prevention**: How to avoid the issue in future
- **Related Issues**: Links to similar problems

### Agent Integration
- Agents can reference these solutions during problem-solving
- `documentation-specialist` maintains and updates solutions
- `code-quality-reviewer` can contribute debugging insights
- Real-world issues become documentation improvements

This knowledge base improves over time as the team encounters and solves new challenges.
