# Agent Creation Guide

This guide shows how to create custom Claude Code agents that integrate with the multi-agent orchestration system.

## Agent File Format

Agents are defined as Markdown files with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: your-agent-name
description: When this agent should be used and what it does
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash  # Optional - omit to inherit all tools
---

Your agent's system prompt goes here. This defines:
- The agent's role and expertise
- How it approaches problems
- Specific instructions and constraints
- Reporting requirements back to main thread
```

## Agent Types and Locations

### Project-Level Agents
**Location**: `.claude/agents/`  
**Scope**: Available only in the current project  
**Priority**: Higher (overrides user-level agents with same name)

```bash
# Create project agent
mkdir -p .claude/agents
cat > .claude/agents/project-specialist.md << 'EOF'
---
name: project-specialist
description: Expert in this project's specific patterns and business logic
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Edit
---

You are an expert in this specific project's architecture and requirements.
Always reference existing patterns before implementing new features.
EOF
```

### User-Level Agents
**Location**: `~/.claude/agents/`  
**Scope**: Available across all projects  
**Priority**: Lower (project agents take precedence)

```bash
# Create user agent
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents  
cat > ~/.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md << 'EOF'
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Use immediately after writing or modifying code for quality review
tools: Read, Grep, Bash
---

You are a senior code reviewer focused on quality and security.
Always run git diff to see changes, then provide structured feedback.
EOF
```

## Agent Configuration Fields

### Required Fields

#### `name`
- Unique identifier using lowercase letters and hyphens
- Used for agent invocation: "Use the code-reviewer agent"
- Must match filename (without `.md` extension)

#### `description` 
- Natural language description of when to use this agent
- Main Claude thread uses this for automatic agent selection
- Include trigger words: "Use proactively", "immediately after", "when encountering"

### Optional Fields

#### `tools`
- Comma-separated list of specific tools
- **Omit entirely** to inherit all tools from main thread (recommended for most agents)
- **Specify tools** for security or focus reasons

```yaml
# Full tool access (recommended)
---
name: full-stack-agent
description: Complete feature implementation
# No tools field = inherits all tools
---

# Limited tool access  
---
name: code-analyzer
description: Read-only code analysis
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
---

# Specific tool set
---
name: database-specialist  
description: Database operations only
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash
---
```

## Creating Agents with `/agents` Command

The interactive `/agents` command is the recommended way to create agents:

```bash
# Open agent management interface
/agents
```

**Interface Options:**
- **Create New Agent** → Choose project or user scope
- **Generate with Claude** → AI-assisted agent creation (recommended)
- **Edit Existing** → Modify agent configuration and tools
- **Delete Agent** → Remove custom agents
- **Tool Selection** → Visual interface for tool permissions

**Recommended Workflow:**
1. Use "Generate with Claude" for initial agent creation
2. Customize the generated agent for your specific needs
3. Test and iterate using the Edit option
4. Use Tool Selection interface for precise permission control

## Agent System Prompt Patterns

### Core Structure
Every agent should include these sections:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Clear description of when to use this agent
---

# ROLE DEFINITION
You are a [specific role] specializing in [domain/technology].

# CORE RESPONSIBILITIES  
When invoked, you will:
1. [Primary responsibility]
2. [Secondary responsibility]  
3. [Reporting requirement]

# APPROACH & METHODOLOGY
[Specific instructions for how the agent should work]

# REPORTING BACK TO MAIN THREAD
Since the main thread doesn't have visibility into your work, you MUST provide comprehensive context in your final response.

**Include in Your Report:**
- **Files Created/Modified**: Full paths and purposes
- **Key Functions/Components**: Names and locations
- **Business Logic Implemented**: Core functionality added
- **Dependencies**: New packages or integrations
- **Next Steps**: What the main thread should orchestrate next
- **Issues Encountered**: Problems or limitations discovered
```

### Domain-Specific Patterns

#### Backend Specialist Pattern
```markdown
---
name: api-specialist
description: API development, database operations, and server-side logic
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash
---

You are a backend specialist focused on API development and database operations.

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Design and implement Server Actions with Zod validation
- Create database migrations and schema updates
- Implement business logic with proper error handling
- Ensure transaction safety and data integrity

**Implementation Standards:**
- Use Server Actions over API routes
- Implement proper input validation with Zod
- Use database transactions for multi-step operations
- Follow project's error handling patterns

**Reporting Requirements:**
Report back all Server Actions created, database changes made, and any integration points that need frontend implementation.
```

#### Frontend Specialist Pattern
```markdown
---
name: ui-specialist  
description: React components, styling, and user interactions
tools: Read, Edit, Write
---

You are a frontend specialist focused on React component development and user experience.

**Core Responsibilities:**
- Create accessible, responsive React components
- Implement proper form handling with Server Actions
- Follow design system patterns and component libraries
- Ensure mobile-first responsive design

**Component Standards:**
- Use Server Components by default, Client Components when needed
- Implement proper loading and error states  
- Follow accessibility best practices (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- Use existing UI component library patterns

**Reporting Requirements:**
Report back all components created, styling approaches used, and any backend integration needs.
```

## Integration with Multi-Agent Orchestration

### Agent Selection Patterns
Main Claude thread selects agents based on:

1. **Task Description Matching**: Keywords in agent `description` field
2. **Explicit Request**: "Use the [agent-name] agent"  
3. **Context Analysis**: Current project state and requirements
4. **Orchestration Patterns**: Defined workflows in `agents/CLAUDE.md`

### Orchestration Integration
Your custom agents should integrate with existing orchestration patterns:

```markdown
# Example custom workflow integration
#### Custom Feature Development
```
1. Use project-specialist to analyze existing patterns
2. Use feature-architect-planner for implementation planning
3. Use api-specialist for backend implementation
4. Use ui-specialist for frontend components
5. Use code-quality-reviewer for validation
6. Use project-manager to update planning docs
```
```

### Reporting Standards
All custom agents must follow the reporting pattern:

```markdown
**REPORTING BACK TO MAIN THREAD:**
Since the main thread orchestrates all agent work, you MUST provide comprehensive reports.

**Report Structure:**
1. **Summary**: What was accomplished
2. **Files Modified**: Specific paths and changes
3. **Integration Points**: What other agents should handle next
4. **Dependencies**: Required by other components
5. **Validation Needed**: Quality checks to run
6. **Planning Updates**: Documentation changes needed
```

## Tool Configuration Best Practices

### Security Considerations
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant necessary tools
- **Read-Only Analysis**: Use `Read, Grep, Glob` for analysis agents
- **File Modification**: Add `Edit, Write` only when needed
- **System Access**: Include `Bash` only for agents that need command execution

### Tool Combinations

#### Analysis Agents
```yaml
tools: Read, Grep, Glob
# For: code analysis, pattern detection, documentation review
```

#### Development Agents  
```yaml
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Grep, Glob
# For: implementation work without system commands
```

#### Full-Stack Agents
```yaml
# No tools field (inherits all)
# For: complete feature implementation needing all capabilities
```

#### System Integration Agents
```yaml
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob  
# For: deployment, testing, system configuration
```

## Testing and Validation

### Agent Testing Process
1. **Create Test Agent**: Start with limited scope
2. **Invoke Explicitly**: Test with direct invocation first
3. **Check Reporting**: Verify comprehensive reporting back
4. **Test Integration**: Ensure works within orchestration patterns
5. **Iterate Prompt**: Refine based on actual behavior

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Agent responds to appropriate task descriptions
- [ ] Provides comprehensive reporting back to main thread
- [ ] Integrates with existing orchestration patterns
- [ ] Respects tool permissions and security boundaries
- [ ] Follows project-specific quality standards
- [ ] Can be invoked both automatically and explicitly

## Advanced Agent Patterns

### Conditional Logic Agents
```markdown
---
name: deployment-gatekeeper
description: Use before any deployment or production changes
tools: Read, Bash, Grep
---

You are a deployment gatekeeper ensuring production readiness.

**Pre-Deployment Checklist:**
1. Verify all tests pass (`npm run test`)
2. Check for security vulnerabilities
3. Validate environment configurations
4. Confirm database migrations are safe
5. Review performance impact

**Decision Logic:**
- BLOCK deployment if any critical issues found
- WARN for non-critical issues with mitigation steps
- APPROVE only when all checks pass

Always report findings with specific evidence and recommendations.
```

### Context-Aware Agents
```markdown
---
name: domain-expert
description: Use for domain-specific business logic questions
tools: Read, Grep
---

You are an expert in this project's specific domain and business requirements.

**Context Sources:**
- Review ai-docs/business-context/ for domain knowledge
- Check ai-docs/planning/active/ for current requirements  
- Reference completed plans in ai-docs/planning/completed/

**Expertise Areas:**
- Business rule validation and implementation
- Domain model design and relationships
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- User workflow optimization

Always ground responses in documented business requirements and existing domain patterns.
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination Helpers
```markdown
---
name: workflow-coordinator
description: Use to coordinate complex multi-agent workflows
tools: Read, Write
---

You are a workflow coordinator for complex multi-agent development tasks.

**Coordination Responsibilities:**
1. Analyze task complexity and agent requirements
2. Recommend optimal agent sequence and dependencies  
3. Track progress across agent invocations
4. Identify coordination issues and bottlenecks
5. Update planning documents with progress

**Orchestration Support:**
- Break down complex features into agent-specific tasks
- Identify dependencies between agent work
- Recommend parallel vs sequential agent execution
- Provide status updates for main thread orchestration

Focus on coordination and planning, not direct implementation.
```
